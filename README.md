# ü•ΩLovelace‚öóÔ∏è
My repository dedicated to working through Project Lovelace problems. The website can be found at https://projectlovelace.net/.

Each respective project touches on a different aspect of mathematics, physics, logic, or electronics. I first approach each problem 
solving it as simply as possible, and later return to create a gui component as well as optimizing the code. 

Thus far I have completed:<br/>
‚úÖ Speed of Light - Calculates the time it would take light to travel a given distance.<br/>
‚úÖ NAND Gate - Logic calculator.<br/>
‚úÖ Molecular Mass Calculator - Calculates atomic mass of given elements.<br/>
‚úÖ Scientific Temperatures - temperature conversion from fahrenheit to celcius. <br/>
‚úÖ Wind Chill - determines wind chill factor from given temperature and wind speed.<br/>
‚úÖ Almost Pi - pi calculation with a graphic component.<br/>
