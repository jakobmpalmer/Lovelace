# ü•ΩLovelace‚öóÔ∏è
My repository dedicated to working through Project Lovelace problems. The website can be found at https://projectlovelace.net/.

Each respective project is contained in an individual directory. My goal is to complete each problem, and later return to create a gui 
component as well as refactor with a goal of efficiency.
