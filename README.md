# 🥽Lovelace⚗️
My repository dedicated to working through Project Lovelace problems. The website can be found at https://projectlovelace.net/.

Each respective project touches on a different aspect of mathematics, physics, logic, or electronics. I first approach each problem 
solving it as simply as possible, and later return to create a gui component as well as optimizing the code. 

Thus far I have completed:
✅ Speed of Light<br/>
✅ NAND Gate <br/>
✅ Molecular Mass Calculator <br/>
✅ Scientific Temperatures <br/>
✅ Wind Chill <br/>
✅ Almost Pi <br/>
